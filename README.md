## 1. Project Proposal
Correlation between Clutchness of a Tennis Player and his success in his Career

### Motivation
 As a long time tennis watcher I realized that big comebacks in games were the best to watch such as 2025 Roland Garros Final the comeback of Alcaraz from 3 championship point was unbelivable. They are not only continuing for long hours with pure enjoyment, they are also best with the high competition because tennis players in these matches are battling through everything, people who are watching can see the all blood,sweat and the tears of tennis players. Therefore, I thought that why did not I make project from comebacks of tennis and I decided on effects of being a Clutch Player on Career Wins of tennis players.

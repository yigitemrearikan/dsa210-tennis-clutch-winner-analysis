# DSA 210 Project Proposal: The Correlation Between "Clutch" Performance and Career Success in ATP Tennis


## 1. Project Proposal and Motivation
 This project seeks to analyze the relationship between a professional tennis players ability to perform successfully under high pressure scenarios referred to here as "Clutchness" and their overall long-term career success. As a long time tennis watcher I realized that big comebacks in games were the best to watch such as 2025 Roland Garros Final the comeback of Alcaraz from 3 championship point was unbelivable. These matches are not only continuing for long hours with pure enjoyment, they are also best with the high competition because tennis players in these matches are battling through everything, people who are watching can see the all blood,sweat and the tears of tennis players. Therefore, I thought that why did not I make project from comebacks of tennis and I decided on effects of "Clutchness" on Career Wins of tennis players.

## 2. Research Question and Hypotheses

### Research Question
 If we can quantify the Clutchness of a player, does it can correlate with the success metrics (measured by total titles, win percentage and average ranking)?

### Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)
 The quantified measure of the Clutchness Index can not show any significant correlation with the success metrics of a player.
### Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)
 The quantified measure of the Clutchness Index is positively correlated with the success metrics of a player.
 
## 3. Data Sources and Scope 
 ### Data Source
 The dataset will be mainly from "Jeff Sackmann" https://github.com/jeffsackmann and https://www.tennisabstract.com/ which the website also has related github repos and also more detailed informations that I can use for calculation of metrics.
 ### Data Scope
 The Data will contain matches from 2000-2025 for only Men's Singles. I will not include Women's Singles the reason behind is, there is no consistency in winners and some like Maria Sharapova and Simona Halep tested doping positive and also I am not familiar with WTA level tennis for that many long time, therefore I am not including the Women's Singles.
